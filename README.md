### Abstract

In late 2023, South Korea's Financial Services Commission and Financial Supervisory Service introduced a revision to K-IFRS, aimed at enhancing the transparency and accountability of virtual asset issuers and operators. This amendment mandates more detailed disclosures in financial statements concerning virtual assets, thus setting a standardized guideline for accounting practices within the virtual asset industry. The amendment is designed to bolster the reliability of the virtual asset market and enhance investor protection by incorporating examples of note disclosures specific to virtual assets.
This study explores the integration of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), into virtual asset accounting. By utilizing the prompt capabilities of LLMs, this paper presents a method for automatically identifying and analyzing key transaction items in virtual asset trade details and formatting them according to the Financial Supervisory Service's disclosure guidelines. Advanced reasoning features, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), are incorporated to automate the interpretation and reporting processes of virtual asset transaction data.
The integration of AI technologies in corporate accounting is anticipated to transform accounting practices by improving efficiency, accuracy, and strategic value. This case study proposes a technical approach applicable to the management and supervision of virtual asset transactions, emphasizing the role of AI in automating accounting tasks and enhancing strategic decision-making processes. The anticipated outcomes include resolving existing challenges faced by the accounting profession through automation and highlighting the strategic role of AI in this field.
